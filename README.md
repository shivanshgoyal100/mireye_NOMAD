# NOMAD 🛰️

NOMAD is a physical-world decision-intelligence platform built on top of
Mireye's location data API. It answers the questions companies ask about
their physical footprint — where to open a facility, whether a site is
feasible, whether an address is real, what regulatory exposure a location
carries, and how a multi-location network compares — by resolving addresses
into a standardized, cited physical-world profile and running scoring/
decision logic on top of it.

The project is split into three owned modules, built in parallel and merged
into one repo:

| Module | Owner | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** | Vedant | Mireye API integration, data ingestion & normalization, capability endpoints |
| **AI & Decision Engine** | Mansi | Scoring, ranking, recommendation logic, capability-specific reasoning models |
| **Frontend & Product** | Shivansh | Dashboard, visualization, user workflow, demo experience |

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python: 3.11 or higher, pip (backend, ai-engine)
- Node.js: 18.x or higher, npm (frontend)
- A Mireye API key and base URL

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd NOMAD
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env             # fill in MIREYE_API_KEY and MIREYE_BASE_URL
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
API comes up at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### AI & Decision Engine
```bash
cd ai-engine
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Consumes standardized location data from the backend and exposes
scoring/ranking/recommendation logic back to it — see `ai-engine/README.md`
for its interface once that module is running.

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔌 Backend Capability Endpoints

The backend currently exposes 12 capability routers, mapped to the
opportunity areas in the project plan:

| Endpoint prefix | Capability |
|---|---|
| `/locations` | Health check + location intake |
| `/verification` | Address & Facility Verification |
| `/feasibility` | Site & Facility Feasibility Screening |
| `/site-selection` | Facility & Site Selection scoring |
| `/regulatory` | Regulatory, Zoning & Hazard data |
| `/risk` | Facility & Route Risk |
| `/multi-location` | Multi-Location Operations Monitor |
| `/permit-research` | Location-Based Regulatory & Permitting Research |
| `/decision-engine` | Central vs. Local Decision Engine |
| `/catchment` | Catchment-Based Population & Demand |
| `/reverse-logistics` | Reverse Logistics & Returns Network Planner |
| `/inventory-transfer` | Multi-Location Inventory Transfer Planner |

Each has its own service layer, a Mireye integration wrapper, and an
integration test. `docs/mireye_coverage.md` documents the underlying Mireye
data categories, metadata fields, and known coverage gaps.

## ✅ Current Status

- **Backend:** the 12 endpoints above are implemented and mounted, backed by
  a working async Mireye client (`httpx`, bearer auth) calling
  `/v1/meta/fields` and `/v1/fetch`. CSV/JSON bulk ingestion connectors are
  scaffolded but not built out; error-handling/missing-data behavior across
  endpoints still needs validation; architecture write-up is pending.
- **AI & Decision Engine:** module structure is scaffolded (scoring,
  reasoning, interfaces); scoring/ranking logic and the reasoning pipeline
  are in progress — see `ai-engine/README.md` for current detail.
- **Frontend:** module structure is scaffolded (dashboard shell, location
  input, results pages, API client); build-out is in progress — see
  `frontend/README.md` for current detail.

This section reflects the repo as of the last update — check each module's
own README for the most current per-module status.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

Each module is owned by one person and worked on in its own branch
namespace. `main` is protected — no direct pushes, PRs required, CI checks
must pass.

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b backend/<feature-name>      # e.g. backend/csv-connector
git checkout -b ai/<feature-name>           # e.g. ai/site-selection-scoring
git checkout -b frontend/<feature-name>     # e.g. frontend/dashboard-shell
```

### 2. Work Only Inside Your Module
Stay inside `backend/`, `ai-engine/`, or `frontend/` respectively — this
keeps diffs small, keeps CI fast (each module's workflow is path-filtered to
only run on its own folder), and avoids merge conflicts with the other two
modules.

- **Backend:** add a new capability as `app/api/routes/<name>.py` +
  `app/services/<name>_service.py` + `app/integrations/mireye/<name>.py`,
  then mount the router in `app/main.py` and add a test in `tests/`.
- **AI engine:** add scoring/reasoning logic under `src/scoring/` or
  `src/reasoning/`, expose it through `src/interfaces/`, and add a test.
- **Frontend:** add pages under `src/pages/`, shared UI under
  `src/components/`, and API calls through `src/api/`.

## 🧪 Local Testing & Quality Assurance

Before pushing your changes or opening a Pull Request, run the checks for
your module locally:

**Backend / AI engine:**
```bash
pytest -q
ruff check .
uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # backend only — verify it boots
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm run lint
npm test -- --watch=false
npm run build
```

## 🔀 Pull Request Rules

- Push your branch to remote: `git push origin backend/<feature-name>`.
- Open a Pull Request targeting `main`.
- Branch name and PR title must be tagged `[backend]`, `[ai]`, `[frontend]`,
  or `[chore]` — enforced by `pr-checks.yml`.
- Ensure all automated GitHub Actions CI checks pass for your module.
- Describe what the PR adds — for backend PRs, note which Mireye fields or
  endpoints are involved.
